2. cd into the corresponding directory

### Using Roll-Out

- Register a new account.
- Upon registering a new profile you will be greeted with a prompt to make your first character.
- Once you are in the character creation process, you will first be asked to choose a class. The cards have info on the back as you hover over them. Click on a card to continue.
- Then the user can choose a default character if they want to hop right in or they can choose to move along with character creation and choose a custom character.
- Then the user can choose race which functions much like the class cards. Click a card to continue.
- Here the user will be prompted to enter a character name, level, and description of the character. Click the next arrow to continue.
- The user can then roll their primary stats one at a time or all at once. These are not permanent and can be altered on the character profile page. Click the next arrow to continue.
- Now the users health points are decided and they have the choice to take the average choice or take a chance on rolling for better health. Click to take a rick or click next to continue.
- The user is prompted to choose two languages, three skills, and their alignment. Once these are chosen the finalize character button activates and the user can finish character creation.
- Once done with your character, its card will appear on the main dashboard. The character is deletable if the user so chooses.
- The user can click on their character to show their character profile page which if the user clicks on stats or details they can edit the info and save the changes at any time.
- To add friends on the main dhasboard, click on the + button by the friends list and search for other users.
- Once added the user can click on their friend to go to their dashboard and see their characters. 
- The user can also click on these characters to see their profile but can not edit the data.
- Once you are done click logout to go back to the login page.




## Application Overview


### What problem does your application solve? 

An app that eases new players into creating a character and playing D&D. It breaks up the huge barrier of entry that there is with this genre of tabletop games and allows new users to take in information in a much more concise manner. 

### Who are the target users of this application? 

The target audience for this application is new players to D&D. While it has functionality for those that have done this before, its main goal is to help new players break into the genre.

### What can a user do with this application? 

From logging in a new user should be able to go through character creation without having any prior knowledge needed. Once the character is made they should be able to view their characters profile and see their stats to use in the game. They should also be able to edit their characters to reflect what is going on in the game.

### Why do you want to build this application? 

I want to make this app because this is a genre I love and with how things are right now, having a digital aid to help you into a new hobby or a returning player being able to quickly hop in, is something that’s greatly needed. I know many people that want to play but see the character sheet and get overwhelmed by the amount of information needed and just stop there.

## MVP Definition: 

* As a new player, I would like the ability to create a new character from beginning to end in a way that’s easy to understand.

* As a new player, once the character is created I would like to be able to see it on my main dashboard

* As a returning player, I would like the ability to create a default character and just edit that.

* As a new player, I would like to be able to click my character and see a profile page of their stats so that it is easy to see and use.

* As a new player, I would like to be able to edit my character after it has already been made and update it.

* As a new player, I would like to be able to see other friend’s characters if I wanted to.

## Stretch Goals

* As a new player, I would like to be able to put my inventory items in a tab and save them as needed and delete them as needed.

* As a new player, I would like to be able to put all of my spells in a tab and save them as needed and delete them as needed.
